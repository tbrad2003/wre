    "# NumPy Tutorial\n",
    "Numpy has become the de facto standard package for general scientific computing in Python. Its core object is ndarray, a multidimensional array of a single data type, which can be sorted, reshaped, subject to mathematical operations and statistical analysis. It supports vectorization: a single operation can be carried out on an entire array, rather than requiring an explicit loop over the array's element. For example: \n",
